# Create More Renewable

*(note that I am still very new to using github :D)*
## What does it do?

This mod adds more recipes to the create mod, that's basically it.

## Links

Inspired by the Create: Renewables datapack. You can check it out [here](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/create-renewables/).  
**Really recommended** to use JEI or other recipe viewing mods for all the recipes. You can get it [here](https://modrinth.com/mod/jei).  
This mod also requires the Create mod, you can get it [here](https://modrinth.com/mod/create).
